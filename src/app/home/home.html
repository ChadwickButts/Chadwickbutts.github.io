    <h1>Hi, I'm CHADWICK</h1>
    <div class="welcomeMessage">
        <span>a Full Stack Developer with 7+ years of experience building beautiful, scalable web experiences.</span>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I specialize in crafting clean, high-performance user interfaces and have a strong foundation in 
            both JavaScript and C#. Whether I’m building with React or architecting backend logic, I focus on 
            delivering seamless experiences that users love. I thrive in collaborative environments 
            that challenge me to grow, and I bring a mix of technical precision, creative energy, and 
            relentless curiosity to every project I touch. I’m currently exploring new opportunities as a 
            Frontend or Full Stack Engineer—feel free to dive into my latest work and see what I’ve been building.
